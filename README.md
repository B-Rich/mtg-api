Please submit all issues for the MTG API here. Any issues about the data itself should be reported to [mtgjson](https://github.com/mtgjson/mtgjson/issues).

All releases will be documented in the CHANGELOG.md file. If you are interested in contributing to the API, feel free to contact me at backes.andrew@gmail.com.

The best way to contribute right now is by creating/enhancing developer SDKs.
